# Scytale Home Assignment
Hi there!

In this home assignment you'll be developing a server integrating with Typeform.

### Prerequisites
1. Read about [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) and sign up.

---
We're going to write a server listening to webhooks from Typeform, create our business entities from clients' responses and generate a policy from a template.

### Requirements
Create a Typeform to understand the following datapoints about the client:
* Company name and website.
* Which cloud provider(s) they use.
* Which executives the company has: CEO/CTO/COO/CISO/CIO.
* The name and email of each executive.

Create a NodeJS server and add a webhook to the Typeform and your server.
The route should adapt the webhook's body and create the appropriate business **entities** in a database.
Finally, create another route to render the policy of a given client from the template (you should change the template as you see fit).


### What we're looking for
- The most important thing is for the server to work :)
- Mantainable code - separation of concerns to modules/functions, easy to extend, etc...


---
Please send us a zip file/github repo with your solution when you finish.
The assignment should take roughly four hours, if you find yourself working on it longer than that, please let us know.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach us through email or the phone.

Enjoy!
